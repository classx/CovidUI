## How does this work

This was made using [Graphaello](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/Graphaello). A tool to use GraphQL directly from SwiftUI.

It's querying the data from [CovidQL](https://github.com/nerdsupremacist/CovidQL) which is loading data from [NovelCOVID](https://github.com/novelcovid/api)
